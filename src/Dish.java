//Create a class called Dish. This class will represent various restaurant dishes.
//Include an integer property called “costInCents”
//Include a string property called “nameOfDish”
//Include a boolean property called “wouldRecommend”
//Include a method called “printSummary” with a void return type
//    this method will use a single printf method to print out the values of each of the instance properties in the following format:
//      Cost: COST_IN_CENTS_HERE
//      Name: NAME_OF_DISH_HERE
//      Recommended: BOOLEAN_VALUE_OF_WOULD_RECOMMEND_HERE
//Create another class called DishTest
//Add a main method and inside the method...
//    1) instantiate a Dish object and assign it to a variable called dish1
//    2) assign creative values for each of the properties
//    3) test the printSummary() method by invoking it and checking if all instance values are correctly printed
